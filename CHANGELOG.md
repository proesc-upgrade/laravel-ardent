Ardent's Changelog
==================

## Laravel 5.0 Compatibility Update

### Changed
- Updated all Illuminate package dependencies from `~5.1` to `~5.0` for Laravel 5.0 compatibility
- Removed `minimum-stability: dev` requirement for better stability
- Package now fully compatible with Laravel 5.0.x

### Notes
This version maintains backward compatibility with Laravel 4.2 code patterns while adding support for Laravel 5.0. All features from the original package remain functional.
